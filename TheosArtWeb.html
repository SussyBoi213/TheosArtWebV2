    welcome to my art website and this <b>is my first website!!</b>
        your probably wondering what i will do here... well here i talk about <b>FAMOUS ARTIST</b>
        today i want to talk about <b>Salvador Dalí</b>
        he is a famous artist that does <b>weird paintings</b>
        here is the name of one of his paintings = The Persistence of Memory
        some people would think that his paintings are scary.... but there just <b>UNIUQE!!!!!</b>
        he started drawing when he was just a <b>child.</b>
        and also... if YOU think that the paintings are weird and Salvador Dalí is on DRUGS.
        THEN YOU ARE ON DRUGS BECAUSE HE IS NOT ON DRUGS YOU LITTLE...
                   Well..... ummmmm......so basicly forget that i ever said that.
        Surrealists weren't pleased with him. i dont know why they didnt. maby because they didnt like his art. that means they are <b>mean</b>
    HE BELIEVED HE WAS A REINCARNATION OF HIS DEAD BROTHER. now.... im not trying to be mean but....i dont think you can be a reincarnation o a dead family member. anyway, how do we know if his brother liked art?😀😀😀🖐🖐🖐
        well thats all for now folks! bye bye!
